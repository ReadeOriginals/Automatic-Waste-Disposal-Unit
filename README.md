# Automatic-Waste-Disposal-Unit
AWD Unit was a 2nd year University driven group project intended to allow different compartments to open for waste disposal, dependent on what was detected by a camera. OpenCV and the COCO image library was used with a Raspberyy Pi 3B, however, newer models (such as the RPI 5) would allow for much greater performance.

This project ran approximately from December 2022 - March 2023, not including preliminary work (such as sustainability and ethics reports).
